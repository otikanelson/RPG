            The air was thick with tension as I stood in my small apartment, the world around me spinning out of control. I had been flipping through an old, dusty book I found in the attic when something changed.
            The air seemed to hum, the pages of the book glowing faintly as a magical sigil burst from its surface. Before I could react, the sigil expanded, dragging me through a swirling vortex of light and shadow.

            When my senses returned, I found myself sprawled across a shattered town square. The buildings were crumbled, their stone and wood skeletons jutting awkwardly from the ground. Strange arcane symbols lit the debris,
            and the air was heavy with the smell of decay. As I groaned, trying to make sense of my surroundings, a figure emerged from the shadows.

            The figure was tall and gaunt, his robes flowing like liquid night. His eyes gleamed with ancient wisdom, and his voice resonated with the power of forgotten realms. He stood over me, his gaze piercing through the confusion in my mind.
            “RiftWalker, you have been chosen” The man intoned, his voice carrying the weight of fate itself. “A rift was torn through your reality, but if you can retrieve the Arcane Shards to seal it, you may have a chance to go back to your reality.”
            As his words sank in, I realized that I was not in my world anymore. The very fabric of reality seemed to tremble. The man handed me the SoulBrand, a shimmering amulet that pulsed with otherworldly power.

            “Align it to light or shadow,” he said cryptically. “The choice is yours. As i... well i have no business with you, my friend, 
            but i could at least provide this little piece of aid and in turn you can rectify some of the wrong which has been done to this world ”
            With that, then he took a step back. "Wait!" i yelled and the man looked over his shoulder and steps towards me again and said
            "pardon me, i haven't made a proper introduction"
