Issues and Improvements:

Battle Dialogue Issues:
- Player and Monster should only have the option of defending or countering when the other is attacking. I need to significantly focus on this battle logic flaw 
- Better action prompts than; "What will you do??" or "How will you respond??"
- Improve Enemy Battle Dialogue to handle every situation properly: Eg, there is no player response dialogue to ShadowBeast's Magic attacks

Ui Issues:
- Clickable Image in equipped Items box that player uses to use potion
- Equipped Items box should be expandable(At least 80% wide modal)
- Victory/Gold or Item(reward) should trigger in game alert or modal
- Shopping for Items should trigger modal. 
- Character life shows in two places(remove the one above the choice buttons)
- Better general game screen design(especially color combination)

Story Issues:
- Progress the story further

The Improvement code should be organized in the appropriate files.
